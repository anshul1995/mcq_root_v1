        This week you mastered â€¦. concepts. Now, we want to give you the opportunity to use your newly acquired
        knowledge and make a useful contribution for future students, that can help them learn better! This
        activity would also encourage the development of your higher-order cognitive skills and lead to a deeper
        understanding of these concepts!
        <br><br>
        Thus, in part 2 of this assignment, you have to create an MCQ supported by an explanation of how to
        arrive at the correct answer. If you consent, we would also like to include the created MCQ for future
        question banks or assessments.

        Create a Multiple choice question with one correct answer and 3 incorrect options. Please select 1 or more
        topics from the list on the right to create your MCQ. You just answered 6 MCQs which are all good examples
        of multiple-choice questions that promote higher-order thinking. All of them have the following features,
        which you should keep in mind while creating your MCQ:<br>
        <ol>
            <li>
                The question should be very clear, and not likely to be ambiguous.
            </li>
            <li>
                There must be only one correct answer.
            </li>
            <li>
                All 3 incorrect options should be plausible. If an option is obviously wrong for all the students,
                then it is not a good option. A good incorrect option should be plausible to a student who has not
                yet learned the skill or knowledge that the MCQ is trying to assess.
            </li>
            <li>
                Your MCQ should require the students to think more than simply repeating memorized facts.
                Higher-order thinking requires students to do something with the facts: apply them, analyze them,
                organize them, align them to concepts and connect to other concepts, question and critique them, and
                use them to creatively solve problems.
            </li>
        </ol>
    </p>
    <p class="row">
        Finally, in 1-2 sentences, explain why the option indicated by you as correct is indeed the correct answer.
        If required, you may also explain why the other options do not qualify as correct answers.
